  oh. look. me. [my hair is long now but I still sport an undercut if that counts?]

  Erm, well I'm a philosophy/psychology major turned lawyer turned editor turned...hobbyist coder? 
  But what I really want to be is a writer. Funny how life works.

  My favorite color is black. Not that you asked. It's not because I'm a dark, depressed soul (though I am).
  I think probably it's because black is sort of simple and inconspicuous? Hard to argue with. And I am 
  constantly seeking to be inconspicuous and hard to argue with. Conflict avoiders rise up!

  Stealing my data and my carefully crafted words you shameless thief.

  Oh. Guess I could tell you my name. (Should've led with that, damn.) Well, it's ND.
  No, that's not my given name, but I'm trying it out.

  My last name is Smith. So, yeah, good luck googling that one we are pretty common 'round these parts.

  This exercise has become mostly embarrassing so I will now show myself out.
