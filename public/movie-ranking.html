<h1>ND Watches Movies Sometimes</h1>
<h2>and sometimes they like them</h2>

<hr />

<h3>1. Spiderman: Into the Spiderverse</h3>
<p>The only thing to not like about this movie is that Miles' dad is a cop and that's unfortunate. 
   But everything else is sublime. The animation is gorgeous. The dialogue is funny. The characters are lovable. 
   The character designs go hard af. I had a hard time choosing between this one and the sequel because boy do I love 
   Hobie Brown and Pavitr Prabhakar. And Miguel O'Hara so sorry for forgetting you babe. But this one is just such a
   classic. Genre-shifting.</p>

<h3>2. It's a Wonderful Life</h3>
<p>Idk if I actually like this movie this much or I was just exposed to it so much that it has wormed into the good
   graces corner of my brain. We watched it every year at Christmas time when I was growing up. And you know what,
   it has some d*mn good themes about the evils of capitalism and the importance of community work, so.
   Plus Jimmy Stewart is like an icon or something I guess. A classic. Heartwarming, entertaining classic.

<h3>3. The Emperor's New Groove</h3>
<p>Yes. Yes. Just...yes. I mean, Kronk. Need I say more? But I will. Because not only are the vocal performances
   totally on point (shoutout Eartha Kitt rip you were an icon and a goddess) and the animation great - the story is good,
   original, funny, and some of those lines of dialogue/scenes are eternally and I mean eternally quotable. See, for example,
   "I never liked your spinach puffs!" or maybe "Why do we even have that lever?" or a little "By all accounts it doesn't make sense."
   Bromance at its finest, great music, yeah, it's a good one.
